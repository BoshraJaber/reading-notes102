# JavaScript & Jquery:
* JavaScript can be used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user-friendly.
* jQuery makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.
* JavaScript can access and modify content of websites.
* Have Program rules or instructions the browser can follow.
* React to events triggered by the user or browser.
## The ABC in Programming:
### A: What is a script and how do I create one?
* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal, like recipes, handbooks, and manuals.
* To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
 Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
* Consider how you might approach a different type of script.
* Often scripts will need to perform different tasks in different situations. You can use flowcharts to work out how the tasks fit together.
* The flowcharts show the paths between each step.
### B: How do computers fit in with the world around them?
### C: How do I write a script for a web page?

# Expressions + Operators:
* **An expression** evaluates into (results in) a single value.
* **Expressions** rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
## Mathematical operators: 
Mathematical operators and their order of execution:

## String operators:
* There is just one string operator: **the+ symbol**. It is used to join the strings on either side of it.
* There are many occasions where you may need to join two or more strings to create a single value.
* Programmers call the process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string **concatenation**.

# Functions:
## What is functions:
* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. 
* If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
## Declaring a function:
**function** Function-Name() {Code Block;}
## Calling a function:
Function_Name();
## Declarings function that needs information:
**function** Function-Name(parameters) {Code Block; **return** parameters;}
## Calling a function that needs information:
Function-Name(parameters value);
