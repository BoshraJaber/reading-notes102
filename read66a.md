#  JavaScript & jQuery
## Writing a script for a **web page**:
1. Three parts come together:
JaveScript language completes the work of HTML and CSS and the result is a very interactive and beautiful page

2. Progressive Enhancement:
These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called *progressive enhancement*.


| HTML | HTML+CSS | HTML+CSS+JS |
| ---- | |---- |
| Building main structures | Adding more colors and rules to give a good look | Making your page more interactive |
3. Creating a basic Javascript:
JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script.
4. Linking JS with HTML:
* The HTML <script> element is used to load the JavaScript file into the page. 
* It has an attribute called src, whose value is the path to the script you created.
* This tells the browser to find and load the script file
4. Objects and Methods:

# Basic JS Instructions:
1. Statements:
* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
* Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. 
* Statements should end with a semicolon.

 Note: Keep in mind that JS is case sensitive.
 2. Comments:
* You should write comments to explain what your code does.
* They help make your code easier to read and understand.
* This can help you and others who read your code.
3. Variables:
A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
4. Variables Declaration:
