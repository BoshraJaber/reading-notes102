#  JavaScript & jQuery
## Writing a script for a **web page**:
1. Three parts come together:
JaveScript language completes the work of HTML and CSS and the result is a very interactive and beautiful page

2. Progressive Enhancement:
These three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called *progressive enhancement*.


| HTML | HTML+CSS | HTML+CSS+JS |
| ---- | |---- |
| Building main structures | Adding more colors and rules to give a good look | Making your page more interactive |
3. Creating a basic Javascript:
JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script.
4. Linking JS with HTML:
* The HTML <script> element is used to load the JavaScript file into the page. 
* It has an attribute called src, whose value is the path to the script you created.
* This tells the browser to find and load the script file
4. Objects and Methods:

# Basic JS Instructions:
1. Statements:
* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
* Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. 
* Statements should end with a semicolon.

Note: Keep in mind that JS is case sensitive.
2. Comments:
* You should write comments to explain what your code does.
* They help make your code easier to read and understand.
* This can help you and others who read your code.

3. Variables: A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
* Variables Declaration: For that we use the variable keyword **var** followed by a **space** then **the name of the variable** then **;**
* Assign a value to a variable: Variable name= variable value;
4. Data Types: 
* Booleans
* Numbers
* Strings
Note: we assign all of dtat typer to variables.
5. Naming a variable: Here are six rules you must always follow when giving a variable a name:
* The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore. It must not start with a number.
* The name can contain letters,numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore. Note that you must not use a dash or a period in a variable name.
* You cannot use keywords or reserved words.
* All variables are case sensitive.
* Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.
* If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word.
