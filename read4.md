# Duckett: HTML & CSS

# 1. Structure: Design and build Websites
* HTML pages are text documents.
* HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
* Tags are often referred to as elements.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.

# 2. HTML Layout:
* The new **HTML5** elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
* The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
* Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
* To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.

# 3. Process and Desgin:
* It's important to understand w XX ho your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

# 4. Extra Markup:
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
* You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
* <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
* The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
