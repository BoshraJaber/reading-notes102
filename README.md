# Growth Mindset

As the name suggests, A _**Growth mindset**_ is simply a state of mind where you allow yourself to tackle obstacles and grow beyond any difficulties.
A Grown mind is a mind that has no room for *negativity* or *despair*. On the contrary, it is a mind that helps you develop your fundamental abilities through *perseverance* and *hard work*.
Although intelligence and talent are contributing factors to success, they are not enough. but when they combine with a growth mindset, the sky is the limit :muscle:.
