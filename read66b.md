# 1. What is a computer?
Computers are everywhere and are built to help us with thinking work, like solving an equation, tracking the stars in the sky and so on.
The sky is the limit when it comes to computers applications
# 2.How does a computer work?
The way that very computer works is:
* Inputs: data that need to be processed.
* Process: algorithms that are designed to deliever the desired output from the input.
